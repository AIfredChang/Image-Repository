# Image-Repository
current version can be tried on heroku: https://imagerepo2021.herokuapp.com/ 

## Instructions: 
right now a person can create an account and upload images (using the tabs in the header). Will be adding more features to create a better user experience. 

## How it works:  
This image repository is created using Node.js, Amazon S3, and a MySQL database. Account and image information is stored on the database, while the actual image is placed in 
a S3 bucket.
